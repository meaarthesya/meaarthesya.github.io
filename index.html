     <h1>How To Take Care Of A Child</h1>
     <p> What you do the first three years of your baby’s life directly impacts the adult your child will become. New breakthrough research tells us that the first three years of a child’s life are more important for emotional and intellectual growth than we ever thought before. Experiences that fill babies’ first days, months and years have a decisive impact on the structure of a child’s brain and, in turn, on every aspect of a child’s life throughout adulthood.

So remember, when you cuddle, coo and sing lullabies to your baby, you are not just expressing love, you are providing vital nourishment for his or her healthy development. Quite simply, the first years last forever.
     
     <h2>1. Be warm, loving and responsive.</h2><p>Pay attention; respond consistently, quickly, and affectionately particularly when they are sick, hurt, upset, hungry, sad, frightened or lonely. Use words and facial expressions that match your child's feelings, for example, you are sad. Some children cry more than others do.</p>
     <h2>2. Respond to the child’s cues and clues.</h2><p>Instead of reacting with your own strong emotions when your child does something, take a minute to think about how to respond. You might want to yell when your child draws on the wall with crayons, but if you take a minute to think, you can respond calmly and address their needs.</p>
     <h2>3. Talk, sing, and read to your child.</h2><p>Even before they can speak, babies are able to associate words with their meanings. This is also a fun age to start bringing baby to storytime at the library. In addition to providing the benefits of reading to baby, it also offers some social stimulation. </p>
